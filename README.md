## Climate Analysis and Exploration

Used Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of my climate database.

* Used the provided [starter notebook](climate_starter.ipynb) and [hawaii.sqlite](Resources/hawaii.sqlite) files to complete my climate analysis and data exploration.

* Used SQLAlchemy to store the data by linking python

### Precipitation Analysis

* Retrieved the last 12 months of precipitation data

* Used pandas DataFrame to analyze the data and plot the data.

### Station Analysis

* Designed a query to calculate the total number of stations in the dataset.

* Designed a query to find the most active stations (i.e. which stations have the most rows?).

  * List the stations and observation counts in descending order.

  * Using the station id with the highest number of observations, calculated the lowest, highest, and average temperature.

* Designed a query to retrieve the last 12 months of temperature observation data (TOBS).

  * Plotted the results as a histogram with `bins=12`.

## Step 2 - Climate App

Designed a Flask API based on the queries that I created.

### Routes

* `/`

  * Home page.

  * Listed all routes that are available.

* `/api/v1.0/precipitation`

  * Converted the query results to a dictionary using `date` as the key and `prcp` as the value.

  * Returned the JSON representation of my dictionary.

* `/api/v1.0/stations`

  * Returned a JSON list of stations from the dataset.

* `/api/v1.0/tobs`
  * Queried the dates and temperature observations of the most active station for the last year of data.

  * Returned a JSON list of temperature observations (TOBS) for the previous year.

* `/api/v1.0/<start>` and `/api/v1.0/<start>/<end>`

  * Returned a JSON list of the minimum temperature, the average temperature, and the max temperature for a given start or start-end range.

  * When given the start only, calculates `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for all dates greater than and equal to the start date.

  * When given the start and the end date, calculates the `TMIN`, `TAVG`, and `TMAX` for dates between the start and end date inclusive.
